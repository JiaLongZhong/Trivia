<table><tr><td> <em>Instructions: </em> <p>Each week I&#39;ll record your contributions to the class/group following the same outline.
You&#39;ll export this assignment to markdown (or download it as a markdown file) and add it to your group&#39;s Github.
You&#39;ll want to change the file name to include your ucid so it doesn&#39;t conflict with anyone else&#39;s files if it&#39;s in the same directory.</p>
<p>It&#39;s required to keep this branch in sync with all team members each module/week (you shouldn&#39;t cause anyone to lose their work).

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <ol><br><li>Our group set up centralized logging to one of our group member&#39;s<br>VM. Jia and I found rsyslog to be our best option due to<br>how easy and minimal it was to set up. After setting up central<br>logging we tested the connection and made sure everything was up and running.<div><br></div><div>2.<br>I set up a MySQL server on my VM for testing purposes. I<br>configured user accounts so my group members could access the database with their<br>own credentials. I created a test registration page to check database connectivity and<br>tried to insert data which was successful.</div><br></li><br></ol><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I ran into problems setting up permissions for my group members to access<br>PHPMyAdmin. I resolved it by logging into PHPMyAdmin as the root user and<br>allowing their IPs to access it.<br></p><br></td></tr>
