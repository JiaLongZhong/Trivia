<table><tr><td> <em>Instructions: </em> <p>Each week I&#39;ll record your contributions to the class/group following the same outline.
You&#39;ll export this assignment to markdown (or download it as a markdown file) and add it to your group&#39;s Github.
You&#39;ll want to change the file name to include your ucid so it doesn&#39;t conflict with anyone else&#39;s files if it&#39;s in the same directory.</p>
<p>It&#39;s required to keep this branch in sync with all team members each module/week (you shouldn&#39;t cause anyone to lose their work).

Not only is it open source but once<br>you figure it out its very easy to implement. Now both App vm<br>are being load balanced specifically when vm1 goes down then vm2 will have<br>the traffic redirected. When vm1 comes online vm2 is removed from the redirection.<br><br></div><br></td></tr>

The only issue were personal,&nbsp; most members including myself, weren&#39;t able<br>to meet to many times due to conflicts. Other than that we attempted<br>to synchronize via discord messages.<br><br></p><br></td></tr>
