<table><tr><td> <em>Instructions: </em> <p>Each week I&#39;ll record your contributions to the class/group following the same outline.
You&#39;ll export this assignment to markdown (or download it as a markdown file) and add it to your group&#39;s Github.
You&#39;ll want to change the file name to include your ucid so it doesn&#39;t conflict with anyone else&#39;s files if it&#39;s in the same directory.</p>
<p>It&#39;s required to keep this branch in sync with all team members each module/week (you shouldn&#39;t cause anyone to lose their work).

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>On Sunday morning, Smit was providing each member user access to phpMyAdmin; other<br>than him; no one was able to access the database. I recommend he<br>change the user host connection from their external IP address to any IP<br>address, which solves that issue. Another issue was that our team couldn&#39;t input<br>registration data into the database. Javier and I did some troubleshooting and figured<br>out the one line of code in register.php have an additional space [it<br>took 30+ minute to find]. Lastly, I couldn&#39;t connect to register.php because I<br>was missing a step sudo cp * /var/www/html -r.<br></p><br></td></tr>
