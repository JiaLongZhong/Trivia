<table><tr><td> <em>Instructions: </em> <p>Each week I&#39;ll record your contributions to the class/group following the same outline.
You&#39;ll export this assignment to markdown (or download it as a markdown file) and add it to your group&#39;s Github.
You&#39;ll want to change the file name to include your ucid so it doesn&#39;t conflict with anyone else&#39;s files if it&#39;s in the same directory.</p>
<p>It&#39;s required to keep this branch in sync with all team members each module/week (you shouldn&#39;t cause anyone to lose their work).

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>the issue was arising from running the shh keygen command in the wrong<br>place and it is outside where the cloning of the repo was. I<br>contributed to solving it from research the correct order and solving how to<br>read out the proper ssh key. Then using it to link the VM<br>to my github completing the issue of mapping the SSH key.<div><br></div><div>The other contribution<br>this week was helping to figure out the different roles that are needed<br>to create a music comparison platform.</div><br></p><br></td></tr>
