<table><tr><td> <em>Instructions: </em> <p>Each week I&#39;ll record your contributions to the class/group following the same outline.
You&#39;ll export this assignment to markdown (or download it as a markdown file) and add it to your group&#39;s Github.
You&#39;ll want to change the file name to include your ucid so it doesn&#39;t conflict with anyone else&#39;s files if it&#39;s in the same directory.</p>
<p>It&#39;s required to keep this branch in sync with all team members each module/week (you shouldn&#39;t cause anyone to lose their work).

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>this week I worked on structuring our files for the separate servers, as<br>well as ensuring scripts are working to be able to keep the files.<br>the base script was worked on to be able to test if a<br>service is installed. along with work on failover and being able to write<br>it over. another issue worked on was the SQL tables to ensure they<br>create tables correctly. I had also put work into creating the structure for<br>the game consumers, and API consumers. to be able to get the api<br>server to be working as intended, the app is able to send a<br>message to it and it is able to then insert the questions into<br>the db via the MQ. work on the migrate scripts for api and<br>db also was worked on this week.<br></p><br></td></tr>
