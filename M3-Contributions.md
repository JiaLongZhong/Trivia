<table><tr><td> <em>Instructions: </em> <p>Each week I&#39;ll record your contributions to the class/group following the same outline.
You&#39;ll export this assignment to markdown (or download it as a markdown file) and add it to your group&#39;s Github.
You&#39;ll want to change the file name to include your ucid so it doesn&#39;t conflict with anyone else&#39;s files if it&#39;s in the same directory.</p>
<p>It&#39;s required to keep this branch in sync with all team members each module/week (you shouldn&#39;t cause anyone to lose their work).

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>As a group we meet together to see if each member can successfully<br>access phpMyAdmin. Another issues is that the team couldn&#39;t add any registration data,<br>but after troubleshooting and meticulously reviewing the code, Javier and Jia were able<br>to find the small issue that was resulting in an error.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>No issues with the group members. Smit and Jia were very helpful in<br>setting up phpmyadmin. Dominic took initiative in researching more backend information. Javier was<br>patient in doing the rsyslog research and directly helping me catch up. We<br>are all responsive and active when needed.<br></p><br></td></tr>
